		<p class="top-news-paragraph">
      <span class="news-date">8th June 2017 - </span><span class="top-news-body">Months of hard work and preparation have worked in George's favor, as he entered the Superfinals of the Serbia's Got Talent contest! Being chosen as one of the superfinalists of the show by the TV audience's SMS votes has proven that not only he is a top notch illusionist, but also an entertainer with a great energy and charisma! The illusion he chose to present at the Superfinals, which was broadcasted live in Serbia, as well as in several neighboring countries, is his version of the famous Metamorphosis, invented and performed by legendary Houdini - the most famous magician ever! George's gorgeous assistant is handcuffed, placed in a bag, and locked in a box on stage. George steps on the lid of the box, covers himself for a brief second, and instantly a miracle happens - the girl is now on top of the box instead of George, who is later found locked and handcuffed in the box! The judges commented that his act was absolutely stunning, and that his performance was on the highest level! Click on image to watch the video!</span>
